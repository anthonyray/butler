# Butler
A toy static website generator from scratch, written in Clojure. 

## Introduction

`butler` is a CLI that helps me generate pages for my personal [website](https://anthonyray.github.io/). 

The goal of `butler` is to generate web pages from markdown source files.

It's also a toy project that I'll use to learn Clojure !

## Installation

Butler can be built and used on your machine if you have leiningen installed. 

### In brief 

Run the following commands :
```
./install.sh
./deploy.sh
```

And you're good to go ! 
### Details
What happens behind the scenes : 
The install script runs the following command : 
```
lein uberjar
```
This will generate a standalone jar for butler. 


The `deploy` script will then create an executable from the standalone jar. 
```
cat stub.sh target/uberjar/butler-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar > butler && chmod +x butler
```
This will generate an executable that you can add to your PATH. 

I decided to create a deploy script that will copy this executable to `~/Applications/butler/` so that it's in my path.
